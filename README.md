# Smart Speed Bump

The Intelligent Speed Bump project is aimed at creating a smart speed bump system using Arduino and C++. This system detects vehicles' speeds and activates the speed bump mechanism when vehicles exceed a certain speed limit, helping to enforce safe driving practices in areas where speeding is a concern.
